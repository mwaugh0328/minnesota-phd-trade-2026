### Why should you be interested in this course?

The them of my portion of the course will be on quantitative trade models and the role of imperfect competition. 

One of the key motivations for engaging in trade are the disciplining effects through competition that it has on domestic competitors. In other words, trade is a two-for in the sense that one gets traditional gains, but also "pro-competitive" benefits.

To get to this point, I'm going to focus on the Eaton and Kortum (2002) framework. In particular, I'll provide a new presentation of how this works. This presentation will help us in exploring issues about (i) the efficiency properties of the model and (ii) alternative forms of heterogeneity. A lot of this will connect with current thinking on my work with Simon Mongey. From here, I plan to cover papers that focus specifically on pro-competitive issues in trade.  

**Side note.** You'd have to be totally clueless to not realize that questions about trade are some of the most important in economics right now. The US (and the world) is embarking on one of the largest revisions of the world trading system in the past 80 years. This raises many questions of interest to the research community, policy makers, and general public. 

**Side note II.** My site from last year is here [Minnesota Phd Trade 2025](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/minnesota-phd-trade-2025).

### The plan

* **Tuesday 3rd February**: Detailed discussion of the [Eaton and Kortum (2002)](./readings/EK2002.pdf)  model. Here are my **new** [class notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaugh0328/minnesota-phd-trade-2026/main/notes/ce-ek-notes.pdf) with detailed walk through as to how the model works. 

* **Thursday 5th February**: Finish up class notes. Connect with gains from trade and ACR.

* **Tuesday 17 February**: Detailed discussion of the [BEJK (2003)](./readings/BEJK.pdf)  model. Here are my **new** [BEJK class notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaugh0328/minnesota-phd-trade-2026/main/notes/bejk-notes.pdf). 

* **Thursday 19 February**: Discuss welfare with variable markups. Detailed discussion of simmulation/ computation of BEJK / EK framework. Here are my notes on the [simulation of EK/BEJK models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaugh0328/minnesota-phd-trade-2026/main/notes/ek-simulation.pdf). Code to simmulate this stuff is in the [code](code/) folder



<!--
* **Monday 10th February**: Continue with optimal tariff in more general settings and quantitative implications.

* **Wednesday 12th February**: Political economy arguments for tariffs: [Grossman Helpman 1994](./readings/grossman-helpman.pdf).

* **Wednesday 26th February**: Redistributive motives [Adao, Costinot, Donaldson](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31798)

* **Monday 3rd March**: Quantitative analysis of trade wars: [Ossa 2014](./readings/ossa-2014.pdf), [Ossa Slides](./readings/trade-wars-slides.pdf)

* Class notes on [optimal tariffs](./notes/optimal-tariff-notes.pdf) the non-EK discussion above.

### Deliverables

* [Problem Set](./problem-set/problem-set-waugh.pdf). Due April 1st. 

* Group presentation. This will be discussed jointly with Doireann and I.

---

### Code

* My julia code for the [Armington-CES model](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/julia-armington) and compute optimal tariffs.

* My julia replication of gravity regressions in [Eaton and Kortum (2002)](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/julia-eaton-kortum) and [Waugh (2010)](https://www.waugheconomics.com/uploads/2/2/5/6/22563786/sr435_itid.pdf)

### Resources:

* Here is a comprehensive course that was taught by [Donaldson and Costinot](https://dave-donaldson.com/teaching/#tab-id-1). Lots of interesting stuff here.

* Treb Allen's (and Costas) their [notes](https://sites.google.com/site/treballen/graduate-trade).

* Gravity datasets are here at [CEPII](https://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele.asp)

* [World input-output datasets](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/valuechain/wiod/?lang=en) usefull to construct tradeflows across countries and industries.
